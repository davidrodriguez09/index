        <p>Stars are born from vast clouds of gas and dust called nebulae. Under the force of gravity, these clouds collapse, and as the material condenses, the core heats up and ignites nuclear fusion. This process powers the star, causing it to shine brilliantly. Stars play a crucial role in the universe by producing light and heat, which are essential for the survival of life on planets. They also forge heavier elements in their cores, which are later released into space when the stars explode as supernovae. These elements become the building blocks for new stars, planets, and even life, creating a continuous cycle of birth and rebirth in the cosmos.</p>
